git-xflow
=========

An extension to [git-flow](http://github.com/nvie/gitflow), which automatize some usual tasks related to repository operations.



Getting started
---------------

As *git xflow* extends *git flow*, it is required to know what *git flow* is about:

* [Vincent Driessen's branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
* [Jeff Kreeftmeijer's blog post about git-flow](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/)
* [Daniel Kummer's git-flow cheatsheet](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)

Of course, a knowledge of *git* is also required:

* [Git official documentation](https://git-scm.com/documentation)
* [GitHub git cheat sheet](https://services.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)

*git xflow* automatizes some reccurent tasks with *git flow*, such as:

* `git xflow feature/release/hotfix close` to finish and push a feature/release/hotfix
* `git xflow staging` to merge the content of unfinished features into a staging (demonstration) branch
* `git xflow hotfix publish/pull` to publish and pull a hotfix
* and many more !

To get help, just type in a terminal : `git xflow`



Install git-xflow
-----------------

*git xflow* runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. In facts, it runs everywhere *git* is able to run.

1. [Install git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/wiki/Installation)
1. Clone or [download](https://github.com/golflima/git-xflow/archive/master.zip) git-xflow, then unzip files ...
1. Put files into a PATH listed folded ([see details for Windows and Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)))
1. For Linux only, make *gix-flow* file executable with:
   * `chmod +x git-xflow`
1. Test it, type in a terminal : `git xflow`

*NB : File `gitflow-common` is taken from [git-flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvie/gitflow/develop/gitflow-common) directly,
you don't have to copy it if you use latest version of git-flow and have put file `git-xflow` in the same folder as git-flow files.*

*git-xflow requires Bourne Again Shell (bash).*



Command-line reference
----------------------

See [Command-line Reference.md](docs/Command-line Reference.md) in docs folder.



Quick setup of git-xflow in a git repository
--------------------------------------------

1. Initialize *git-flow*:
   * `git flow init`
1. Initialize *git-xflow*:
   * `git xflow init`
1. Optionnaly, tell *git-xflow* to automatically open generated files from
   templates (when calling `git xflow patch` or `git xflow review` for example):
   * On Windows, to automatically open html files generated by reviews with Google Chrome:
     * `git config --add gitxflow.exec.html '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"'`
   * On Linux / Mac OS, to automatically open html files generated by reviews with Google Chrome:
     * `git config --add gitxflow.exec.html "google-chrome"`
   * On all platforms, to automatically open log files with less:
     * `git config --add gitxflow.exec.log "less"`
   * On all platforms, to automatically test generated zip archives:
     * `git config --add gitxflow.exec.zip "unzip -t"`



Quick overview of major git-xflow features
------------------------------------------

1. Start working on a new feature *A* by typing:
   * `git xflow feature start A`
1. Do some work and commit your changes with: `git commit`
1. Start working on another new feature *B*:
   * `git xflow feature start B`
1. Do some work and commit your changes with: `git commit`
1. Send your changes to *staging* branch, only for feature *A*, by typing:
   * `git xflow staging reset A` *(this will reset staging branch)*
1. Then, send your changes from feature *B* to *staging* by typing:
   * `git xflow staging merge B`
1. Review changes of feature *A* with a HTML file by typing:
   * `git xflow feature review A -t html`
1. Review changes of feature *B* with *less* file by typing:
   * `git xflow feature review B -t less`
1. Finish your work on your features by typing:
   * `git xflow feature close A B`
1. Eventually, reset your *staging* branch to a clean state (*develop*), by typing:
   * `git xflow staging reset`
1. Do a release *1.0.0* for your new features by typing:
   * `git xflow release start 1.0.0`
1. Share your work on this release *1.0.0* with your peers by typing:
   * `git xflow release publish 1.0.0`
1. Start working on a shared release *1.0.0* by typing:
   * `git xflow release pull 1.0.0`
1. Finish and publish release *1.0.0* by typing:
   * `git xflow release close 1.0.0`
1. Build a patch to deploy changed files on your remote server which does not have Git by typing:
   * `git xflow tag patch` *(will make a patch from previous published tag to the new one)*
